# Testing Extensions

## Issues to investigate:
1. Button command not inserting
2. Poll command not working
3. Footnote not inserting
4. Financial Chart not working
5. Poetry toggle not working
6. LaTeX insertion

## Debugging steps:
1. Check if extensions are registered
2. Test commands in console
3. Verify command syntax
4. Check for TypeScript errors

## Quick fixes to try:
- Add console.log in command handlers
- Test if editor.commands object has the methods
- Verify extension names match command names
